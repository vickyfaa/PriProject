# Modern & Clean Portfolio Website
## Overview

This project is a professional portfolio website template designed with a clean aesthetic and modern features. It's built with semantic HTML5, styled with CSS3, and enhanced with vanilla JavaScript for interactivity. The goal is to provide a polished and memorable user experience for showcasing skills and projects.

## Key Features

* **Vibrant & Modern Design:** A visually appealing theme using a bright, professional color palette and clean typography. The hero section uses a striking gradient to capture attention.

* **Sticky Navigation:** As the user scrolls down the page, the navigation bar sticks to the top of the viewport for easy access to all sections of the portfolio.

* **Smooth Scroll & Animations:**
    * Clicking on navigation links results in a smooth scroll to the corresponding section.
    * Sections gracefully fade into view as the user scrolls, implemented efficiently with the **Intersection Observer API** for great performance.

* **Interactive UI Elements:** Hover effects on cards and buttons provide visual feedback, improving user engagement.

* **AJAX-like Contact Form:** The contact form provides an instant "Thank you" message upon submission without reloading the page, creating a seamless user experience. The message automatically disappears after a few seconds.

* **Professional Codebase:** The project uses a well-organized and commented codebase. It features a semantic HTML structure and responsive CSS using modern techniques like Grid Layout.

* **Responsive & Mobile-Ready:** The layout is fully responsive and adapts seamlessly to all screen sizes, from mobile phones to desktops.
